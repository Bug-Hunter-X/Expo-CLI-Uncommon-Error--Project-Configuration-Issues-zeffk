This error typically arises when the Expo CLI attempts to interact with a project that isn't correctly configured or has inconsistencies in its setup.  It often manifests during builds or when using certain Expo commands.  The root cause is usually an issue with package.json, app.json, or the underlying project structure.  For example, missing dependencies, incorrect versions, or conflicts between package versions can trigger this. Another possible cause is corruption within the project's node_modules folder.
