The solution involves a multi-step process to identify and fix inconsistencies in the project structure and configurations.  First, ensure that your `package.json` file is accurate and includes all necessary dependencies. Double-check that version numbers are correct and compatible. Next, carefully examine your `app.json` file to ensure its correctness and alignment with your project setup. Delete the `node_modules` directory to resolve any potential corruption within it, and then reinstall dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.

If the issues persist, consider these additional steps: 
1. Check for any conflicting packages that might cause issues and resolve those conflicts.
2. Verify the accuracy of your Expo configurations to ensure they align with the desired behavior.
3. As a last resort, consider reinstalling the Expo CLI using the appropriate instructions for your operating system. 

By systematically resolving these possible causes, you should be able to overcome this uncommon error.
